# 📩 Spam Message Identifier

A Machine Learning–based web application that classifies messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
The project is built with **Python**, **NLTK**, and **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters a message in the input box.
2. Text is preprocessed:
   - Lowercasing
   - Tokenization
   - Removing stopwords and punctuation
   - Stemming
3. Processed text is transformed using a vectorizer.
4. The trained ML model predicts whether the message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**.
